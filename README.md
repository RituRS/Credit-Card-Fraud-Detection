# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection


**INTRODUCTION**
This Credit Card Fraud Detection project leverages machine learning and data analysis methodologies to create a robust system for identifying fraudulent credit card transactions. The primary objective of this project is to build an intelligent model capable of distinguishing between legitimate and fraudulent transactions with a high degree of accuracy. By doing so, this project aims to protect consumers from unauthorized charges, reduce financial losses for credit card companies, and enhance overall financial security.
